    The following alignment engines are available.

    **UFast-Engine**: ultra-fast, based on a home-brewed algorithm, faster than blazing fast but can only process en-zh para/sent pairs, not as sophisticated as DL-Engine;

    **SFast-Engine**: super-fast, based on machine translation;

    **Fast-Engine**: based on yet another home-brewed algorithm, blazing fast but can only process en-zh para/sent pairs;

    **DL-Engin**: based on machine learning, multilingual, one para/sent takes about 1s.
